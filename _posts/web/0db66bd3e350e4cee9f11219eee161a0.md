# Again, nothing to do with ASCII really, but has been requested by a number of you out there. To get special characters to show on an HTML web page, special HTML codes can be used (ascii code or word) and are interpretted by the web browser. These HTML codes are otherwise referred to as html entities, html characters or html symbols.

再一次,没有整理ASCII的欲望了,但是还有一系列你需要的东西,为了在html网页上显示特殊字符,可以使用特殊的html代码在浏览器中显示特殊的字符,这些字符可以表现为html实体,html字符或者html符号
